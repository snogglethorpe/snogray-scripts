Various handy shell scripts for use with Snogray renderer.

runsnog
	Run snogray with the given args, and write an additional
	".snlog" file containing some meta-data (command-line args
	etc) and a transcript of the run.  Has special support for
	restarting an aborted run.  The .snlog file will have the same
	basename (and directory) as the output image file.

runcmpsnogs
	Run two different versions of snogray multiple times with the
	same arguments, using "runsnog" to record the runs into .snlog
	files.  "sumsnoglog" can then be used on the resulting .snlog
	files to produce a summary of the average execution times for
	both.

sumsnoglog
	Analyze .snlog files produced by "runsnog" (maybe indirectly
	via runcmpsnogs), and produce a summary of the average
	execution times (broken down by "tag", and into loading,
	rendering, etc, times).
